Player Renderer lets you render your player to an NPC Spritesheet.

How To Use:

1. Drip out your character
2. Zoom out to 100% (if the slider doesn't go down to 100%, disable Forced Zoom in the tModLoader Settings)
3. Ensure proper lighting (this will affect the resulting sprites) - Daylight recommended
4. Face to the left (not required, but NPC sprites are expected to face left)
5. Type "/render <name>" in the chat, substituting <name> with your desired name

It supports:
- Base Character
- Armors
- Vanities
- Accessories

* Note: vanity must be worn in the armor slot for it to show up
