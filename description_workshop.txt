Player Renderer lets you render your player to a Town NPC Spritesheet.

A video tutorial with examples can be found on the Steam Workshop page or below.

[h1]Generating The Sprite[/h1]

1. Drip out your character
2. Zoom out to 100% (if the slider doesn't go down to 100%, disable Forced Zoom in the tModLoader Settings)
3. Ensure proper lighting (this will affect the resulting sprites) - Daylight recommended
4. Face to the left (not required, but NPC sprites are expected to face left)
5. Type "/render <name>" in the chat, substituting <name> with your desired name

The sprites will be saved in the `Sprites` directory, next to `Players` and `Worlds`.
