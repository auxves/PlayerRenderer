# PlayerRenderer

Player Renderer lets you render your player to an NPC Spritesheet.

## How To Use

1. Drip out your character
2. Zoom out to 100% (if the slider doesn't go down to 100%, disable Forced Zoom in the tModLoader Settings)
3. Ensure proper lighting (this will affect the resulting sprites) - Daylight recommended
4. Face to the left (not required, but NPC sprites are expected to face left)
5. Type `/render <name>` in the chat, substituting <name> with your desired name

## Supports

- Base Character
- Armors
- Vanities
- Accessories

> Note: vanity must be worn in the armor slot for it to show up
